# Hathor Nano Contracts IDE

Welcome to the **Hathor Nano Contracts IDE** documentation. This project provides a complete Remix-like development environment for Hathor nano contracts, enabling developers to write, test, and deploy contracts directly from their browser.

## 🚀 Features

- **Web-based IDE**: A full-featured code editor powered by Monaco Editor with Python syntax highlighting.
- **Real-time Validation**: Instant feedback on your nano contract rules and syntax as you type.
- **Local Execution Engine**: Run your contracts locally using a complete Hathor nano contracts implementation simulation.
- **Interactive Testing**: Test your contracts with balance simulation and debugging tools.
- **Deployment Integration**: Seamlessly deploy your contracts to the Hathor testnet or mainnet (Planned).

## 🎯 Goals

This toolkit aims to:

1. **Democratize nano contract development** by removing barriers to entry.
2. **Provide instant feedback** for faster development cycles.
3. **Maintain full compatibility** with the production Hathor network.
4. **Enable educational use** for learning nano contracts.
